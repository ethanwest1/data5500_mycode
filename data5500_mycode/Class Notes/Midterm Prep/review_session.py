### OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMIG

Class is a blueprint, object is what it builds
Self is self. It keeps track of the object.
Mutable vs immutable: mutable can be changed (teenage mutant ninja turtles), immutable cannot be changed. 
 ##    KNOW HOW TO WRITE A CLASS DEFINITION    ### 

3 pillars of object oriented programming:
    -Encapsulation: provides data protection on a user level.
    -Inheritance: a child hast the same properties as it's parent class. 
    -Polymorphism: any functionality that a parent class has, the child can do that and more. (Won't be anything hard on the test.)

##LOOK INTO THIS MORE## Array vs.  list: Everything in a list is an object, we don't know where the memory is stored. Arrays, you make a specific request to the OS about how much memory you need.
Queues vs. stacks: Fifo vs lifo: what you use depends on what you're doing. 
  -append adds objects to a lsit, pop removes them. (Pop with no arguments removes the last item from the list.)

Merge sort:
  - breaks the list into smaller lists(buckets), and then re-merges them, while ordering them. 
  - Nlog(n)::  N: number of items in the list, log(n) number of breaking down the list. 

Remind yourself how to create a python dictionary.
